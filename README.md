# QRL-WiDS-22

Material and code for the Quantum Reinforcement Learning project (part of WiDS 2022-23)

Progress so far:
- [Week 1 QC, Complete] Completed QC reading material, re-implemented and analysed some algorithms in Qiskit. Reports (partial) and code are available in the folder **Week1-QC**
- [Week 1 RL, Complete] Completed Sutton-Barto Chapters 1, 2, 3, and implemented and analysed different bandits in Python. Report (partial) and code are available in the folder **Week2-RL**. Completed CS747 Lectures 6 and 8.

Some reports are still remaining though, will complete when free.

Update: We completed the final project! Here is a link to my copy of the repo: [final project link](https://github.com/mathismusic/RL-Based-Quantum-Circuit-Generator).
